# TrimNet: a new deep learning method for learning molecular representation from triplet messages
## Machine Learning with Prof. Giampieri, University of Bologna 

***The original code is not my work: it can be found [here](https://github.com/yvquanli/TrimNet) and is based on the work described in [this article](https://academic.oup.com/bib/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bib/bbaa266/5955940).***

### Study and implementation
The study of this new **TrimNet** method and an in-depth description of the modifications performed on it for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/gretagrassmann/Machine-Learning-Exam/blob/main/MachineLearning.pdf).

### Requirements
```
$ PyTorch >= 1.4.0
$ torch-gemetric >= 1.3.2
$ rdkit >= '2019.03.4'
$ Python 3.7 (installed with Anaconda) is recommended
$ In plot.py and comparison_plot.py the PATH to the csv files have to be changed
```
